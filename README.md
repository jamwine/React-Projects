# React-Projects

* **React** is a JavaScript library for building **User Interfaces**. It is responsible for the **view layer** of our application.
This means it is only responsible for rendering our User Interface (such as the text, text boxes, buttons, etc.) as well as updating the UI whenever it changes.

* For example, consider building an e-commerce website that maintains the number of items in the shopping bag as the user adds and removes items. 
React makes it easier to show the number of items in the shopping bag: `{items.length}`, and updates the bag whenever it changes.

* It also allows us to reuse this logic in another part of UI. For example, on the payment page, we can reuse the same logic without having to re-write it.

* **React is a library and not a framework**.
The difference between a library and a framework is that a library only helps us in one aspect. In contrast, a framework helps us in many aspects. For example:
  * **React** is a library because it only takes care of our UI.
  * **Angular**, on the other hand, is a framework because it handles much more than the UI (It handles Dependency Injection, CSS encapsulation, etc.)

* React itself is not a UI Library as in it does not give us beautifully designed buttons or cards.
It helps us manage complicated UI but does not come with a design system. It will be up to us to choose a design library or use CSS to make it look nice and user-friendly.
